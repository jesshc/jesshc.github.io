              <h2>Spread and Decontamination</h2>

              <p>Following the accident, the Brazilian government initiated a large-scale screening operation in Goiania. Experts from the Brazillian Nuclear Energy Commission discovered that the cesium powder had been spread 100km from Goiania by wind and rain. Of the nearly 113,000 people screened for radioactive contamination, 249 people were found to be irradiated externally, and at least 129 internally through inhalation and ingestion of the powder, meaning these people themselves were radioactive.</p>

              <p>The dose of radiation that these people were exposed to ranged from several Millisievert to 7 Sievert. However, even an exposure of 5 or more Sievert can be fatal. Furthermore, radiation can also destroy cells of the human body, such as skin, hair, and bone marrow.</p>

              <p>For the 54 victims who were hospitalized, doctors tried to eliminate cesium in their bodies by administering induced perspiration and Prussian blue. Prussian blue is an iron compound that binds with cesium to help excrete it out of a patient's body. The problem is that the treatment takes at least a week to be effective and during this time cesium would have moved from bloodstream to tissues, where it will be difficult to remove. In the end, 4 people died from the radiation, including the scrap dealer's 6 year old niece. Their bodies had to be encased in lead-lined caskets to prevent contaminating the underground soil and water.</p>

              <p>The Brazilian government began decontamination efforts in November 1987 by using helicopters equipped with radiation detectors to identify the hot spots of the cesium powder. They found contaminated furniture, cars, buses, and money.  Contaminated houses were demolished. However, much of the powder was soaked into the soil. Some soil was removed and stored in concrete-lined drums. To seal off the remaining radiation in the ground, cement was poured on top of the soil. The radioactive wastes were stored temporarily at a surface site about 30 kilometers from the city until a permanent nuclear waste disposal site could be found in Brazil.
